Neural networks with non-linear activations work like universal function approximators. There is some function that maps your input to the output. For example, images of handwritten digits to class probabilities. The power of neural networks is that we can train them to approximate this function, and basically any function given enough data and compute time.\n",

For this we calculate a **loss function** (also called the cost), a measure of our prediction error. For example, the mean squared loss is often used in regression and binary classification problems\n",

We find this minimum using a process called **gradient descent**. The gradient is the slope of the loss function and points in the direction of fastest change. To get to the minimum in the least amount of time, we then want to follow the gradient (downwards). You can think of this like descending a mountain by following the steepest slope to the base.\n",

    "## Losses in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by seeing how we calculate the loss with PyTorch. Through the `nn` module, PyTorch provides losses such as the cross-entropy loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`). You'll usually see the loss assigned to `criterion`. As noted in the last part, with a classification problem such as MNIST, we're using the softmax function to predict class probabilities. With a softmax output, you want to use cross-entropy as the loss. To actually calculate the loss, you first define the criterion then pass in the output of your network and the correct labels.\n",

    "This means we need to pass in the raw output of our network into the loss, not the output of the softmax function. This raw output is usually called the *logits* or *scores*. We use the logits because softmax gives you probabilities which will often be very close to zero or one but floating-point numbers can't accurately represent values near zero or one ([read more here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html)). It's usually best to avoid doing calculations with probabilities, typically we use log-probabilities."

To make sure PyTorch keeps track of operations on a tensor and calculates the gradients, you need to set `requires_grad = True` on a tensor.
